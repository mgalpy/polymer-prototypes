polymer-prototypes
==================

Simple interactive prototypes meant to demonstrate new designs.


To try them out, simply open Terminal (on Mac OSX) and type:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then in your browser navigate to:

    localhost:8000

And select the file you want to try out.

If you want to try rapidly developing some prototypes of your own, the quickest way to get started is by duplicating the polymer-ultimate.html file as this contains every component you need (feel free to add new ones as they are released or as needed).
